This is currenty a non-operational work in progress!

This is intended to become a Java library (.jar) which will be able to be used to easily compile ebooks without having to know anything about them!  It'll guess/assume as much as possible, creating pretty ebooks from just a selected text.

In time, however, I'd also like to see this used as a base for a ruby gem I've been dreaming up for a while, but we'll haev to see about that...
