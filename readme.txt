This is currenty a non-operational work in progress!

This is intended to become a Java library (.jar) which will be able to be used to easily compile ebooks without having to know anything about them!  It'll guess/assume as much as possible, creating pretty ebooks from just a selected text.  The idea is to have an ebook library that can create pretty, usefull books without having to know anything about EBooks, and not having to even think about custimizing it much.

In time, however, I'd also like to see this used as a base for a ruby gem I've been dreaming up for a while.  This likely won't come for another month or so.
